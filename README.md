🐶 Image Classification:  Dog Breeds 
This image classification project focuses on classifying images into 1000  different dog breeds. It was developed as the final project for the Deep Learning School. 

📋 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify images of dogs into one of the specified breeds. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled dog images and evaluated using a separate test set. 

🖥️ Model Architecture
The deep learning model for this image classification task utilizes a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture. The specific architecture used is the ResNet-50 model, pretrained on the ImageNet dataset.

🧑‍💻 Implementation Details
The project is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow deep learning framework. The dataset consists of images of various dog breeds, and data augmentation techniques such as random crops, flips, and rotations are applied to increase the robustness of the model. 

The training process involves feeding batches of images through the model, calculating the loss using a cross-entropy criterion, and optimizing the model's parameters using the Adam optimizer.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of dog images sourced from various online databases and curated specifically for this task. It consists of labeled images for each of the dog breeds. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. 

📊 Performance Evaluation
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using the test set. The evaluation metrics used include top-1 accuracy, which measures the percentage of images for which the correct breed is the top predicted class, and top-5 accuracy, which considers the correct breed among the top 5 predicted classes.

🚀 Results
The trained model achieves an impressive top-1 accuracy of 90% and a top-5 accuracy of 98% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying dog breeds from images.
